| **Date** | **Time** | **Notes** | **Pics / Links** |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| 26/3 | 5h | Designing and made a est. bill of mat. on paper |  |
| 27/3 | 3h | Making rails and other misc parts |  |
| 28/3 | 11h | Heatbed and NEMA 17 and redesigned the whole thing on paper ðŸ˜­ I was going with a design like Bambu but shifted to Ender-like |  |
| 29/3 | 5h | CAD for the random things and made BOM |  |
| 31/3 | 10h | Assembly and made the Y axis, not full. Asked Aarush, he helped me |  |
| 31/3 | 1h | Exported all files and uploaded to GitHub and added imgs ðŸŽ‰ Also today I learned that we can move components using the mouse and no need to use M key ðŸ˜‚ Also added the BOM and donâ€™t judge me okay I still use Excel ðŸ˜­ Made some minor changes in my drawing |  |
| 1/4 | 30min | Tried to find for cheap but shii didnâ€™t got any and even if I got they have no HCB support |  |
| 1/4 | 1.5h | Made the 2020 rails, the ones I was using were of diff dimensions | [Link](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C08B7LF58TX/p1743497795204829) |
| 1/4 | 2h | Idler pulley setup and bearings |  |
| 1/4 | 1h | After 2hr idler pulley was done but shi the pulley wasnâ€™t aligning with the stepper motor pulley height then had to do some cut here and there so it matched the heights |  |
| 1/4 | 2h | Made this holder to hold the 8mm rods for Z axis | [Link](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C08B7LF58TX/p1743524871616339) |
| 1/4 | 1h | Made a diff Z axis holder as prev one not fitting |  |
| 1/4 | 1h | Made Z axis rod fitting and aligning all parts, Z axis rods done now some of Z and X full left |  |
| 2/4 | 30min | Color correction and aligning the 8mm rods to Z axis holder |  |
| 2/4 | 1h | Z axis holder but for the top â€” added the KFL008 bearing to it and expanded area of that so the screw holes match and assembled that into "bot asm" file (printer's assembly) |  |
| 2/4 | 30min | I had to change some setting in the Z axis holder that I prev made as the one I made earlier was perfectly fitting in left side but for right I need to make a separate one. This means Z axis is complete |  |
| 2/4 | 1h | Trying to cut costs (20$ less from previous) |  |
| 5/4 | 2h | Drawing in paper the X axis (Why is soooo hard to make a desiggnnnnn) |  |
| 7/4? | 2â€“3h | Learned what the hell is Core XYâ€¦ as I am fkedâ€¦ I am going to Core XY now as I canâ€™t do tool heads with Cartesianâ€¦ why am I so dumbmâ€¦ Nooooo |  |
| 7/4 | 1h | Made the X axis rail holder |  |
| 7/4 | 1h | Worked with the X axis but this shi is hard and I am crashing out because I did HackDucky YSWS PCB (PCB team), then infillâ€¦ itâ€™s ig 15h me being near the screenâ€¦ I am feeling so sleepy fk |  |
| 7/4 | 2h | Designed the tool changer like how the hell it will work and research |  |
| 8/4 | 2h | Designed a holder for Z axis (with bed) also read this | [Link](https://3ddistributed.com/corexy-3d-printer/corexy-kinematics) *(will add img later as it's making probs)* |
| 8/4 | 10min | Added support | *(will add img later as it's making probs)* |
| 8/4 | 33min | Watched this so I understand this more as I am unable to think how is the pulley connected to 2020 | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAN5AzEWCg) |
| 8/4 | 2h | Making the Z mechanism so my Z works with only one motor (but I think 2 is better), I will do 2 laterâ€¦ Also I will be making the bed holder myself (to cut costs ofc) so making the Z axis mech â€” it was rods with lead screw earlier but now itâ€™s same but improved lol | ispiration https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAN5AzEWCg&t=919s T = 10:40 |
|8/4|1.3hr|Z X Y all placeing dome now need to add the pulley system .. the pullys and belts that wont be much of a issue.. now left is tool changer.. I started with cartesian for cost now i am at corexy Learing 2 printers is crazy and also who tf uses both solidworks and fusion (its me ðŸ’€)|
|9/4|1.6hr|most time in research and math lol ... made the pully holfer for corexy belts |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f624f20e-6214-4be7-924a-af84bd361eaf)|
