# 3dspire

Idea: Simple CoreXY printer
Goal:
- Faster than my Ender 3
- Quality part printing (tunning pls!)
- Relatively space efficient
- Option to add an encloser

# Update one:
Time spent: 4 hours

I created an initial parts list. Chose a BTT motherboard due to the low price and having four motor outputs. I need four due to having two z motors. I am using Nema 17 42x48 due to the high torque and low price. The pack has five motors, which I might want to use to add a triple z system for nonplanar printing. 

# Update two
Time spent: 2.5 hours

I started to cad out with a basic design with linear rails and extrusions for the motion system. Used 3D printed joints for low cost and flexibility of design. Added a COTS hot-end assembly for simplicity. I will change this later.

# Update three
Time spent: 4 hours

I changed the rail from mounted on its side to mounted on the top of the extrusion. This helps me make the whole printer smaller.

I also changed the hotend+extruder temp to a dragon bunner. I will probably use this mounting system to allow esay swap of hotends. I also changed the size to a 250x250 build plate after realizing how small a 180-180 is.

# Update Four
Time Spent: 5 hours

I figured out the belt paths from this image:

From that, I designed the v0 part of the belt systems. I added double sheer support on the motors to prevent unnecessary wear and tear.

# Update five
Time Spent 20 hours

I designed the z and bed mounts. This required me to move the crossbeam holder up to have the z-axis mounts on the inside, as shown below. I wanted this so I could easily bold on side panels later without worrying about producing elements. I chose to 3dpint an extrusion due to extrusions being sold in packs of 2 or 4, this saves around 10-15 dollars and should not compromise on anything.

# Update six
Time spent 10 hours

For my hot-end assembly, I wanted to use 2 5015 fans for a lot of cooling; this makes the whole size pretty big. Along with this, I would need a good extruder and hot end to keep up. I chose to use an x1 hot-end clone due to the low price and pretty good performance. I also used a COTS extruder due to this design being around the same price as the motor and gears needed. I also added a BL touch for bed leveling.
