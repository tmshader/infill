Idea: Simple CoreXY printer


Needs: Faster than my ender 3

Parts list:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-p1FSMkBJRRGZg3B695Q9pYF5o_9TisIYr6g5MQPlGU/edit?usp=sharing

Update one:
Made a initial parts list and designed XY movement. 

The parts list took around 4 hours 2.5 hours for design.

Hopefully, I'm done with the basics for x and y.
