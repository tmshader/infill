# Progresses
## Feb 9

So i finished watching this video, and i think that I'm ready for the cad part, I still have to choose the size of the printer, but i think that it'll be around the same as an Ender 3. as soon as i can i'll start doing some research for parts like the printing bed, the stepper motors and the touchscreen display to start planning the BOM

Research: 30m

## March 5

Today I continued the BOM by adding the pulley and the timing belt, I also continued a bit the CAD design by adding some parts for the printhead motion, I still have to find the right linear actuator for the printing bed and I'm planning to take it from an open source printer like the Voron

CAD: 45m
Research 45m

## March 6

Soooo,  today I continued the CAD by adding the aluminium profile and the supports for it, I also found a cheap linear actuator for the Z axis, so as soon as I finish with the printhead, i should be ready for the buildplate, i'm thinking to use the ender 3 plate but i'm still looking for a cheaper option

Cad and researching: 1h

## March 10
I almost finished the motion part for the printhead, I added the support that attaches the printhead to the aluminium profile which is on the linear rails, and I finished the attachments for the pulleys of the linear rails. Next step is the printhead, then the printbed and I'll finish with a general check to see if I've forgotten some little details.

1h30 Cad 

## March 11

Started designing the printhead and researching the best component for it, so far I added to the BOM: 
- Nozzle
- Micro limit switch
- Hotend
- Hotend bracket
- Heat bed
- Filament tube
- Hotend fans

I still have to import all the parts in the 3d model, but as soon as I end with the printhead I'll start working on the printbed, and then I'll just have to check everything and the printer should be ready

2h of researching


## April 08
2h of cadding to make it ready to ship

## April 09
I already submitted te design but i still got to check if the weight of the printer will prevent the printer from rotating and then falling, here what i found so far, but it's not finished yet:
