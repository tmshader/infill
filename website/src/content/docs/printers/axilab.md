# Progresses
## Feb 9

So i finished watching this video, and i think that I'm ready for the cad part, I still have to choose the size of the printer, but i think that it'll be around the same as an Ender 3. as soon as i can i'll start doing some research for parts like the printing bed, the stepper motors and the touchscreen display to start planning the BOM

Research: 30m

## March 5

Today I continued the BOM by adding the pulley and the timing belt, I also continued a bit the CAD design by adding some parts for the printhead motion, i still have to find the right linear actuator for the printing bed and I'm planning to take it from an open source printer like the Voron

CAD: 45m
Research 45m
