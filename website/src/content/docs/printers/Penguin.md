2/13/25 - 2 hr (2 total)
Started Project, began researching basics on 3D printers, watched Youtube videos and builds

2/14/25 - 1 hr (3 total)
Continued basic research, began thinking about design requirements, studied other DIY 3D printers

2/15/25 - 3 hr (6 total)
Watched more YT videos on 3D printers, researched and created BOM for toolhead, began importing models to CAD. Time was spread out throughout the day

2/16/25 - 3 hr (9 total)
Finished draft of BOM, began cadding mounts etc to connect everything together (spent an hour trying to find a 3d model of carto. probe to no avail)

2/17/25 - 2 hr (11 total)
Continued working on toolhead, began thinking about frame and movement system

2/18/25 - 1hr 30m (12.5 total)
Researched and worked on frame design. Spent wayyy to long creating a linear rail model.

2/23/25 - 2hr 30m (16.5 total)
Struggled to download and use autodesk cdf. When I finally began running simulations, they were all completely goofed. Notably:

3/4/25 - 1hr 30m (18 total)
Settled on frame designl, bedslinger. Began working on X axis mount and belt drive.

3/8/25 - 2hr 30m (20.5 total)
Locked in on CFD, created first two iterations of my first design, a 2 stream blower funnel.
V1:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6fb6bbf-abf5-4dd4-85ee-c999e6ce05dc)
V2:![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e30228c6-5c0f-4b0e-804d-912f68678d95)
Both completely missed the nozzle end ._.

3/9/25 - 3hr (23.5 total)
Finished second version of the double funnel, promising first results

Finished the frame and brackets for all 3 axis. The printer's really starting to come together.

3/10/25 - 1hr (24.5 total)
Began researching for beds and electronics
Finished X and Z movement systems (specifically belt mounts)
Build volume is currently looking to be around 19 x 25 x 16 (xyz), which I'll definitely have to look into tomorrow. One way is to cut down the Y axis by 5, which brings the volume to a fairly square 19x20x16

Did some random small work. Here's the current build volume roughly visualized (24x24x18)

3/14/25 - 2hr 30m (27.5 total)
Finished up (almost) all of the 3D printer not including electronics

3/15/25 - 1hr 30m (29 total)
Started the day with minimal knowledge on 3d printer electronics setups, ended with a solid grasp of components and how they work together. 

3/16/25 - 5hr (34 total)
Finished researching electronics and finalized parts needed. Went through the BOM and checked and counted up everything. The costs seemed to shoot up significantly after I actually tallied everything up, going from my expectation of ~250 to 350. I spent a lot of time switching and cutting parts to get this number down. One of which was replacing the cartographer probe with a BL Touch clone.

Here's the full printer rendered  (ooh). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2794985-d96e-49b5-ab51-7955f0b84594)

3/18/25 - 2hr (36 total)
Spent some time looking over the the BOM again. After trying to find cheaper alternatives for every part, I got the total down to around 330 total before tax. At this point, I had submitted for the grant and bought all the parts.

3/19-3/24 - 6hr (42 total)
Time was scattered throughout this period. By the end I had basically finished redesigning the printer. (Ignore the glaring issues with bed movement, will figure it out next time)
