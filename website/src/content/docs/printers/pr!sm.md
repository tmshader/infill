# Pr!sm

Born to be made for #infill, forced to be a #highway project \
Jokes aside i'm not sure if i'll ever finish it but i'll try :D

This little github repo will serve as a journal for the entire project. You'll find (*in theory*) everything I did & went through and maybe how I succeeded :)

## Goals

- Fits inside a backpack -> very portable (i'll bring it to hq if i can)
- Bed slinger 3d printer
- 350$ budget (maybe less :/)
- Looks **nice** (eink screen!!!!)
- <del>I don't die in the process</del>
