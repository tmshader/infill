# Pr!sm

Born to be made for #infill, forced to be a #highway project \
Jokes aside i'm not sure if i'll ever finish it but i'll try :D

This little github repo will serve as a journal for the entire project. You'll find (*in theory*) everything I did & went through and maybe how I succeeded :)

## Goals

- Fits inside a backpack -> very portable (i'll bring it to hq if i can)
- Bed slinger 3d printer
- 350$ budget (maybe less :/)
- Looks **nice** (eink screen!!!!)
- <del>I don't die in the process</del>

## May 18th

Working on the precise bom to see if everything can fit in budget :D \
You can access it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ikDKoN0T1L48sfJnj8HsopvuAkS2xJBeX7_AytDlYT8/edit?usp=sharing) \
Then i decided i should better start with a quick sketch and used onshape to do so. \
