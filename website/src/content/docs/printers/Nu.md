# Nu
Nu, a 5-axis 3d printer

Design inspired by this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEgwnhLHy3g&ab_channel=JoshuaBird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEgwnhLHy3g&ab_channel=JoshuaBird)

**Total Time Spent:** 3 hour

# Project specifics
 - no set largness yet, but printbed is 200mm in diamater, and ill build around it
 - circular printbed + cantilevered design
 - 5 axis:
   - c axis of printbed
   - x, z axis of dual-arm system
   - b axis of nozzle

# Goals
 - actually create it
 - make it fairly around the 300$ mark
 - make the firmware work (reprap)

# Todo

  - RESEARCH
  - approx. 10 hours
i mainly use reprap forum, yt videos about mechanical features, learning about advantages of certain designs over other (ex ball screw, vs normal, or belt vs gears)
i also am actively analysing every word in this excellent guide: [drdflo](https://www.drdflo.com/pages/Guides/How-to-Build-a-3D-Printer/FFF.html). 
I have finalised all design, choices, drew some more complex ones on paper, and am starting to create a BOM.
Basically:
 - circular heated printbed 200mm in diamater
 - 220mm, 10mm [sliding rods for printbed](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33036180370.html)
 - using gears, and this [nema 17 motor](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005742670433.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.pcDetailTopMoreOtherSeller.2.76f5nfoNnfoNWn&gps-id=pcDetailTopMoreOtherSeller&scm=1007.40050.354490.0&scm_id=1007.40050.354490.0&scm-url=1007.40050.354490.0&pvid=1afe711d-2e0e-4bf4-9af2-c8a5c796746a&_t=gps-id:pcDetailTopMoreOtherSeller,scm-url:1007.40050.354490.0,pvid:1afe711d-2e0e-4bf4-9af2-c8a5c796746a,tpp_buckets:668%232846%238110%231995&isseo=y&pdp_ext_f=%7B%22order%22%3A%22162%22%2C%22eval%22%3A%221%22%2C%22sceneId%22%3A%2230050%22%7D&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21PLN%2142.79%2123.40%21%21%2110.59%215.79%21%40%2112000034182321935%21rec%21PL%21%21ABXZ&utparam-url=scene%3ApcDetailTopMoreOtherSeller%7Cquery_from%3A), ill rotate the printbed along c axis
