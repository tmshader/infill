This is a 3D Printer with a 4 axis rotating Toolhead.
I haven't decided weather to make this a Core XY or dual estrusion. I want to do something similar to the RotBot:

https://github.com/RotBotSlicer/Transform
https://www.printables.com/model/288723-4-axis-modification-for-mk3s-with-rotational-print
I will probably use stuff from the Neutrino
