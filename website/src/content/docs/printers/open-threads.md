## An attempt at making a sub $200 3D printer from scratch out of mostly printed parts.

# Goals: 
- Overall:
    - Sub $200
    - Instruction-less assembly (can't/very hard to assemble wrong)
- Frame:
    - Entirely 3D printed
    - No supports needed when printing
- Motion:
    - Core XY
    - Direct extruder
        - Remote drive if feasible. _(need to see how much flexible shafts cost)_
    - Auto bed leveling
- Bed:
    - Use 3D printed threads built into the frame for Z movement
    - Heated?
    - 250x250mm print area
