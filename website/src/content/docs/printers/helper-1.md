- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

plan:
make a 3d printer capable of at least 400mm by 400mm and 600mm height 3d printing and be able to print over the internet, (and i want to use ethernet)
this will be useful for printing 3d printed plane wings etc and big things, those are basically my criteria
