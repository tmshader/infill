- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

plan:
make a 3d printer capable of at least 400mm by 400mm and 600mm height 3d printing and be able to print over the internet, (and i want to use ethernet)
this will be useful for printing 3d printed plane wings etc and big things, those are basically my criteria

this is the 3d model of the pcb ill import into onshape, dw i wont order it green, im ordering it white or black

for future self:
remember the two holes should face outwards
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7edd6152-623d-4d67-b5c9-e23cb0df3e1d)
because they are the holes for the wires as you can see here

this is important because in the cad i dont have any other reference:

just found out "drawings" exist, these could have saved me a lot of time and struggle lol

especially right now that i am trying to design some wheels that will fit properly in the cad
