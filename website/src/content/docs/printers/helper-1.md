- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

plan:
make a 3d printer capable of at least 400mm by 400mm and 600mm height 3d printing and be able to print over the internet, (and i want to use ethernet)
this will be useful for printing 3d printed plane wings etc and big things, those are basically my criteria

# Log :

Total hours so far: 82

### Sunday, march 2nd
7 hours

research, looked for parts and worked on a BOM and started looking for cad models for onshape

### Monday, march 3rd
6 hours

looked for more parts, BOM is close to being done and im trying to find ways to cut costs because im going overbudget

### Tuesday, march 4th
6 hours
some more reasearch, i started looking into how i could save costs, i also wasnt sure how i was going to connect the extrusions togheter so i looked into that
i did some research on how i could design the heated bed pcb myself

### Wednesday, march 5th
7 hours
i designed the heated bed pcb

### thursday, march 6th
7 hours
i continued the pcb and then i did some research to look for other websites where i could get parts for cheaper

### sunday, march 30th
5 hours
started the cad and looked for ways to make the bom cheaper, i found some deals 

### monday, march 31st
2 hours
worked on the cad, mostly on making the t slot nuts and extrusions fit togheter and the screws too

### tuesday, april 1st
2 hours
continued the cad and got one adapter done, also started to get the hang of using constraints

### wednesday, april 2nd
2 hours
continued the cad

### thursday, april 3rd

this is the 3d model of the pcb ill import into onshape, dw i wont order it green, im ordering it white or black

for future self:
remember the two holes should face outwards
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7edd6152-623d-4d67-b5c9-e23cb0df3e1d)
because they are the holes for the wires as you can see here

this is important because in the cad i dont have any other reference:

just found out "drawings" exist, these could have saved me a lot of time and struggle lol

especially right now that i am trying to design some wheels that will fit properly in the cad

also added a bit to the bom

### saturday april 5th
7 hours
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0d47316-98c1-4bbe-9af8-9eefb553facc)

the printer is starting come togheter and look like a printer!

then i also started working on the z axis aka the moving bed assembly

### sunday april 6th
7 hours 
continued designing the printer, did some research on how the corexy system works because at first i was going to have one sationary motor and one that sits on the toolhead gantry but then i saw a short yesterday where both where stationary and i realised that using some sorcery you can have no moving motors exept the extruder one

### monday april 7th
4 hours
i finalised the pulley and belt system 
the cad is basically done and i could now build the printer

i also added the cad files and the kicad pcb files to the repo

note to self:
my wood scraps are 8.75cm by 3.75 cm aprox
my screws are: 6 , 1 1/3

(i plan on building some support to hold the printer by the top out of some wood i recycled from an old project)
