# Daedelus

Made by: @Meowkewok  
Repository link: https://github.com/meowkewok/Daedelus  
Total hours so far: 25.5   

- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

Daedelus was a Greek inventor, builder, and tinkerer, hence the name.  
I started this project with a coreXY design, but I flew too high, hence the name/designation Daedelus (Icharus) for the first variant.

## New Design Goals:
- [ ] Under $300 (USD)
- [ ] 310mm3 Build Volume
- [ ] Cartesian Bedslinger
- [ ] Cool design
- [ ] Touchscreen UI
- [ ] Klipper w/ RPi?

## BOM
I just decided to make a spreadsheet using Google Sheets, it was easier. LINK: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hZlX8M_wxNlEcmAArnw9ARre6T5sTla1MoFUZHyh3DU/edit?usp=sharing

## Detailed Log
3/6/2025  
Last time I was working, I finished the Z-Axis, however, I still need a frame...

Need to take a break, but here is progress (after 1 hour):
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf1df8d6-a668-471f-a1fd-dd65f7159161)  
Here is the belt routing pic (ik its a bit wonky):
![XY Axis Assemby v14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac167ef-7925-4199-b3bf-ac91b8dc63a7)  

3/10/2025  
I get my cast off tomorrow!  
I realized that my BOM needs to be cut down, so I started work on that. OG: ~375, Now: N/A  

3/15/2025  
I made a realization that a coreXY just costs too much for this...  
Making new goals, and hopefully this time it will work out, and maybe I can make Daedelus (Icharus) in the future. I simply flew too high.
Started work on the CAD for it, looking real good so far, maybe even better than Icharus! I also started working on the BOM for this one, which hopefully will end better than last time.
![XZ Axis v3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9472b425-5541-4f23-9779-f955bfda6945)  

3/16/2025  
Kept working, here is progress so far:  
![XYZ Axis v2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d936903-57cd-419b-9d47-a01d6e89f8ad)  
Continued working on the BOM, and already it is sooo much cheaper!  

3/27/2025  
Did more CAD and made a logo. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02262cd7-f29a-4057-8ae8-dca04caa174f)

### (OG) Ideas for Attachments:
- 3d Extruder (obviously)
- Dremel/CNC head
- 4-Axis attachment - adds a 4th axis which can be attached to by various toolheads
- Laser (DANGER!)
- Pen plotter

### Credits:  
Thank you to:  
- Rabbi Hametz (RTH) for letting me use school printers and stuff
- Ryan Rich for giving me random ender 3 parts

### Fun stories:
- This printer is being designed with a broken finger (at the beginning at least. Its healed now!)
- Realized I had to redesign the printer half way through since I would never be able to make it affordable enough.
