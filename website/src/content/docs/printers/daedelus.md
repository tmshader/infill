# Daedelus

Made by: @Meowkewok  
Repository link: https://github.com/meowkewok/Daedelus  
Total hours so far: 7.5  

- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

## Design goals: 
- CoreXY
- 300 x 300 x 250 (at least) mm Build area
- Swappable toolhead (maybe magnets?)
- Very rigid
- Under $500
- Looks cool

## Log
|Date |Task |Time |Notes|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|2/21/2025|Set up Repo, ideas, design goals, began BOM, began CAD|4 Hours|Thanks to my brain for finally deciding what to make|
|2/23/2025|CAD, Research|3 hours||
|2/26/2025|Bit more BOM|30 mins|Buying cheap parts from China|

## Ideas for Attachments:
- 3d Extruder (obviously)
- Dremel/CNC head
- 4-Axis attachment - adds a 4th axis which can be attached to by various toolheads
- Laser (DANGER!)
