# Ducc-it
### Day 1 - 2/15/2025 - 12:02 PM

I want to lay some ground rules down for what this printer can do:

- 100mmx100mmx100mm build size
- At least 100mm/s printing
- Fit under $300 USD (under Hack Club's infill budget)
- The printer is rigid enough to produce good quality prints

Going to try and sort out the BOM today

### Day 1 - 2/15/2025 - 1:37 PM

Here is my projected BOM (in USD) so far - need to start the CAD to know what I need next.
