# Ducc-it

Made by: @Dongathan-Jong  
Repository link: https://github.com/Dongathan-Jong/Ducc-it  
Total hours so far: 67

BOM: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qOZgMDn6hGFZKtvJTQ3WRMCq_ESmatV1Npfq33ltyqs/edit?usp=sharing)

### Day 1 - 2/15/2025 - 12:02 PM (1 Hr)

I want to lay some ground rules down for what this printer can do:

- 100mmx100mmx100mm build size
- At least 100mm/s printing
- Fit under $300 USD (under Hack Club's infill budget)
- The printer is rigid enough to produce good quality prints

Going to try and sort out the BOM today

### Day 1 - 2/15/2025 - 1:37 PM (1 Hr)

Worked on my bom, added steppers, aluminum rails, and linear rails.

### Day 1 - 2/15/2025 - 10:36 PM (6 Hrs)

Just did a super long work session ~6h, added a ton of things to the bom! Lead screw, motor bracket, coupler, build plate, linear bearings, and linear rods! Turns out Aliexpress is really my best friend...

I did a ton of work on the CAD, doing pretty good with the cad so far:

I struggled quite a lot as im pretty new to fusion, but all seems to be good! 

### Day 2 - 2/16/2025 - 10:08 AM (1 Hr)

I thought this through, and I will restart this. I realised that with my current progress, I have barely made a dent in my CAD and have already blown through half the budget. I think the current progress is amazing, but even using the cheapest parts I can find, I don't think I can hit my desired $300 budget. I think a bedslinger would be cheaper? Something like the bambu A1, where the z axis is supported on both sides.

The total comes to ~ $139, which excluding electronics and such doesn't sound so feasable. 

### Day 2 - 2/16/2025 - 11:01 PM (6 Hrs) 

I did a bit of work here and there throughout the day, came out to ~ 6 hours. I worked on achieving a cheaper frame, and eneded up settling with a cantilever design, similar to the Bambu A1 mini. Here is the progress for today!

I'll get to updating the BOM soon, maybe tomorrow.

### Day 3 - 2/24/2025 - 4:53 PM (10 Hrs)

Wow... School really put everything to a halt. I updated the BOM and put everything on a spreadsheet, making these tables in markdown SUCK, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qOZgMDn6hGFZKtvJTQ3WRMCq_ESmatV1Npfq33ltyqs/edit?usp=sharing) is the link to that.

I have worked a little more on the CAD, hope to get the mechanics and everything finished by the end of the week, then finish the electronics in the week after. Will be pretty inactive on this project though, going to Scraypard!

Here is the CAD progress:

### Day 4, 5, 6, 7 - 3/1/2025 to 3/17/2025 (~35 Hrs)

School, Scrapyard, HQ, everythings been putting this on the backburner, but I am finally here to continue on the writeup! I did quite a lot of work in between my trips to hq fulfilling hackpad, texas for scrapyard, and others, and have finished the hotend assembly, updating the spreadsheet with everything needed, and have everything done except for the electronics and fan shroud (and the feet but thats not high priority). 

I need to figure out how to make a good looking fan shroud since I'm pretty new to fusion, definitely will figure that out soon. As per now, I have quite a lot of stuff figured out, this is basically the final stretch!

### Day 8 - 3/21/2025 - 11:39 PM (7 Hours)

Finally had some time to work on this, worked ~ 7 hours today figuring out electronics, PSU, what I am going to use since I have zero experience with what I am using. The popular choice was to go with a SKR Mini E3 V3, a 350W Creality power supply, and a RPI3 I have laying around. I also added a roll of Polymaker Carbon Reinforced filament, as the brace for the X axis won't be able to support the weight with normal PLA. This suprisingly took SO long because I watched so many YouTube videos on whats good and what isn't.

I updated the bom, added some GT2 parts, belts, pulleys, etc. The total right now is a little over $290 USD, but I added around $2 to each part, since customs may be an issue.

     alt="Day 8 cad progress"/>

I think I am going to just strap all the electronics under the bed, and create mounts as I go, since I cannot find the right CAD models for the parts. Also, for the self-ejecting part, I plan to use a servo to sweep the bed, but that will also need to be further researched into. 

As of now, I am marking this printer as completed until I recieve the parts to fabricate!
