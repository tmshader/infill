## Spark Console

### Why
I din't want to have a big touchscreen in the center of the machine. I wanted to go for something quince. I chose to have an OLED screen on it to have because it dose not steal the spotlight but can still display useful information. I also added neopixels so that it could have a progress bar that reacts to the current state. Finally I added 8 buttons for commonly used actions for anything more complex you probably want to use the web UI anyway.

### Parts
- XIAO rp2040
- Kailh Chocs
- Adafruit Neoxpixels
- 128x32 OLED
