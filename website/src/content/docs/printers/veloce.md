PS: its still pretty empty, gonna be adding stuf soon

# **Day 1**

Research on feasibility, ideas, premade projects, and deciding goals, along with basic planning

Goals: 
- Can print high quality
- Core XY
- Can print pla, petg
- Speed >300 mm/s
- Build volume around 25 cm^3

Read up, watched many videos on how i could start with the design and building

Time: 4 hrs

# **Day 2**

Figured out the basic design pattern i would follow, the various items i would need
Did some feasibility research and figured out if my ideas would work
Decided on a frame and structure, gonna figure out the tech parts of the BOM soon

- Made design sketches, and found build plate and heatbed.
- Also decided to use an aluminium plate bw the bed and pla support.
- Also found rods, screws and decided on nema 17 motors.
- Started with the BOM, although a lot of work is still to be done.

*The plates are 310x310 mm, so thinking of keeping build volume around 300mm^3*

Time: 8 hrs

# **Day 3**

Worked further on my BOM

Figured out a way to prevent pla warping, but still pretty sure gonna print PETG for parts
Also, found hotend and extruder. A BGM clone and a creality clone. Figured out hotend design as well, just the tech parts and psu is left.
Should be able to get around 300mm/s speed. Soon gonna add the BOM.
Honestly, finding parts has been supr painful. Lik srsly why are chinese stores banned in india :(.
Gonna be using a boden setup, as dont really need to print flexible mats.

Time: 5 hrs (lik srsly, it took sooo long to find any good items)

# **Day 4**

Finished my BOM, decided on all the parts I would need, and made some changes to previously selected parts so I can get about 500m/s print speed.
Also made some basic design plans. Goona start cadding soon. This took way too much time.

Time: 7 hrs

# **Day 5**

Decided to use an aluminium frame to get faster speeds, also 300x300 bed could cause wayyy to many issues on first time build, and cant find any close to 250, so gonna do 235x235 bed now,
so changed BOM and re finalized it. Still gonna keep double z as i want to achieve high quality at faster speeds, so going to try to implement closed loop fixing for realtime z correction and print condition adjustment. Hopefully am able to mk smtg that can print high quality at 500+ speeds. Using cartographer with adxl345 so dont need piezo.

Time: 4 hrs

***Total Time: 28 hrs***

# **Day 6**

Alright, now im modelling.

Started by importing the rails, and building a mount around them. This somehow took much more time than it should have.
Imported the hotend and extruder. Played around with their positioning and then realised that the extruder was wayyyyyyyyyyyy too huge, so either buy to direct drive or gonna be using a different one.
Soooo i decided to use a sherpa micro.

found this neat video, and am just gonna get a pancake stepper from ebay and a set of bmg internals, and make one.
So i changed the extruder and figured out its positioning. I designed basic structures to hold them and placed the heeatbreak cooling fan. 
Also created a scuffed angular structure to hold the cooling fans.

PS: Using GrabCAD a lot and printables etc to get models of these parts.

Time: 8 hrs

***Total Time: 36 hrs***

# **Day 7**

Alright, so i made a proper housing and screw structure for the cooling fans.
Also added the fasteners to the project.
SOOOOOOOOOOO, it turns out im stupid.
I spent a huge amt of time making an angular structure mount for the radial fans, so that they blow air somewhat sideways, but that doesnt really matter.
It seems that it doesnt have any advantages and its creating tooo many issues.

So i redesigned part of it, and replaced everything.

Now i had to build vents to direct airflow.

I did some searching and found this video.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vs4bE6sE1g&t=1255s&ab_channel=LearnEverythingAboutDesign

it pretty much tells you whatever you should know and partly guids you.
So i spent lik an hour building this.
Now, i wanted to do CFD tests.

I tried searching, but couldn't find anything. Lik 30mins of searching later,
found this vid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pMJQetyA4A&t=263s&ab_channel=NeedItMakeIt

This once again teaches you how to do sims. I did the test, and apparently my ducts were wayy too squared
The air was not flowing smoothly and had wayy too high pressure.

So i made the vents curved and redid the tests. Now, there wasn't enough air at the back.
So i remade them, and did another simulation, and finally got good results.
