# Smoother
* title: "Smoother"
* description: "A smooth printing friend..."

Made by: @Mahdi
Repository link: [Click Here](https://github.com/asmahdi08/MuonForge/)
Total hours so far: 7

- I have access to some 3d printers, especially Bambu labs A1, P1S and some anycubic

Total time: 45+ hours 30 mins (Idk how accurate this is probably pretty close tho)

**Micro-3D-Printer** is a compact, budget-friendly 3D printer designed to stay under $300 while maintaining high functionality. It features a filament detection system to automatically pause printing when the filament runs out, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted prints. Built for efficiency and affordability, it’s ideal for makers looking for a reliable and cost-effective 3D printing solution.

### **Plan to achieve**
I ofter notices after 3D prints finish, thin plastic threads (stringing) often appear between gaps or travel paths. This ruins surface quality and usually requires manual post-processing. So I plan to build a system to auto smooth the printing, by automatically blows **precisely controlled hot air** at specific positions, we can do this thing to get smooth print.

 - ### **How it will be**
	 - **Glass Enclosure**:
		 - As shown by your blue outline, the printer is enclosed in a **glass case** to:
		-   Maintain internal temperature.
	    -   Prevent air disturbance.
	    -   Contain hot air application safely.
    - **Airflow System:**
		-   A series of **airflow nozzles** (shown in purple dots on the sides in your image) installed vertically on both sides of the printer frame.
	    -   These nozzles are controlled to release **hot air** in short bursts on specific layers or coordinates post-print.

## **Day - 1, ( 20/03/25 ) - Planning and breakdown idea**  

⏳ **Time Spent:** 4+ hours  

- Watched multiple YouTube videos on **how 3D printers work** and their components.  
- Read various articles to understand **FDM printing, mechanics, and common issues**.  
- Identified **filament detection** as a key problem to solve.  
- Goal: **Keep cost under $300** while ensuring quality.  
- Planned a **filament sensor** to pause printing when filament runs out.  
- Next: Research detection methods, sketch design, estimate costs.  


## **Day - 2, ( 21/03/25 ) - Findings and gather printer idea from exist one**  
⏳ **Time Spent:** 3+ hours  
- **Researching Existing Printers**: Studied features, components, and designs of popular 3D printers to understand how they operate.
- **Identifying Key Features**: Noted the most important features like print volume, filament types, print quality, and ease of use.
- **Documenting Findings**: Organized your notes on design elements, specifications, and potential improvements based on existing models.
- **Evaluating Technology**: Investigated technologies such as auto bed leveling, filament detection, multi-color printing, etc. And sooooo on...


## **Day - 3, ( 22/03/25 ) - Assembly frame structure**  
⏳ **Time Spent:** 2+ hours  

### Description

### Parts Breakdown ( z-axis left & z-axis right)


## **Day - 5, ( 24/03/25 ) - Z-axis limit switch & Y-axis assembly**  
⏳ **Time Spent:** 4+ hours  


### Description
- Firstly i started to design the printer Z-axis and then 
- Design the limit switch here
- After that started to design the Y-axis


- ### Z-axis

## **Day - 7, ( 26/03/25 ) - Feed & Cooling Assembly**  
⏳ **Time Spent:** 4 hours  

### Description
- Here i design the feed and then started to work in the main fun fact so it not miss the filament anymore
-   Added an IR sensor at the filament entry point to detect if the filament is missing.
-   If filament is missing during printing, the sensor triggers:
    -   Automatic pausing of the print
    -   An alert sound.
    -   A popup notification to your phone.
