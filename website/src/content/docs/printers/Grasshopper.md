Today is my first day working on the printer, so I will be mainly focused on research & developing a basic parts list/BOM for the toolhead of the printer

### update 1 :

I discovered the Pico MMU, Rapido ACE UHF hotend & the Sherpa mini extruder today and started planning the basic toolhead of the printer
I began to make a (sort of) BOM that mainly just logs all the prices & sources I found. 

~~beginning tomorrow I will begin the CAD process of attaching the Sherpa Mini & Rapido ACE UHF and make a toolhead around it.~~ (I screwed up lol)

## Current parts list: 

> [!NOTE]
> Price & Source is the case for my part individually. Retail price & retail source could be a more realistic estimate for anyone expecting to build the Grasshopper themselves.

### Update 1:
Today was more research to ensure the parts list were compatible with each other before starting CAD. Turns out, there's a LOT of compatibility issues with this parts list I developed. First of all, the power supply I was planning to use is 330W which won't be enough for this current setup The PSU will be TBD until the rest of the parts are finished to ensure compatibility. Along with that, the Rapido ACE UHF is an impressive hotend but not nearly what it claims to be & even if it was 65mm<sup>3</sup>/s would be an outrageous flow rate for a Sherpa Mini. Instead the Grasshopper is going to use a Dragon HF hotend for extra community support and more [reasonable stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/voroncorexy/comments/o0cuxd/does_anyone_know_max_flow_rate_for_different_hot/) & [price](https://www.trianglelab.net/products/dragon-hotend?VariantsId=11396). Next, the stepper motors from the Ender 3 don't have enough force to enable the speed that the Grasshopper is projected to run at. Instead a 3 pack of motors with *questionable* quality but a great price can be found on [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2255801033887365.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.2.76d645af92nVLa&algo_pvid=b81d5402-f309-40b6-9f3b-66931c66e33a&algo_exp_id=b81d5402-f309-40b6-9f3b-66931c66e33a-1&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%2132.09%2125.99%21%21%2132.09%2125.99%21%402103146c17387183294372792eb597%2110000015342053269%21sea%21US%214468387228%21X&curPageLogUid=UKCwPiWFbb8p&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa).
