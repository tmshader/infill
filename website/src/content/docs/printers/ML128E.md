- [V] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

DAY 0: 
Brainstorming and research
features I want it to have

CONCEPT 1: Lithophane printer
either 4 separate heat blocks or 4 nozzles in one(custom heatblock?)
or maybe a toolchanger?
what if i just slap 2 of these together
(https://www.amazon.com/Extruder-Printer-1-75mm-Filament-Multi-Extrusion/dp/B08BKMM1R7?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&smid=A6II3W9PTX4YQ&gQT=1&th=1)
belt plate (45 degree offset?)

CONCEPT 2: Advanced material printer
high temp hot plate as bed?
(https://www.amazon.com/Soiiw-Soldering-Microcomputer-Electric-100X100mm/dp/B0CN19C4DC?psc=1&pd_rd_w=WcaYb&content-id=amzn1.sym.55c0153f-1fb7-42ff-8241-d1c0f3732289&pf_rd_p=55c0153f-1fb7-42ff-8241-d1c0f3732289&pf_rd_r=Q1RQTSNGKN7B6C32KW3J&pd_rd_wg=6qgJC&pd_rd_r=229346c4-d7c7-4aab-8be7-c1c48ec2fa80&ref_=sspa_dk_detail_img_1&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWxfdGhlbWF0aWM=)
oh shoot thats a long link
plate up to 400c, maybe get a 700c hotend and print aluminum?

CONCEPT 3: Food printer
rotating plate? does not require heated nozzle :D
can use same hot plate above as heated plate
toolchanger for different ingredients?
maybe could even set up a basic ingredient mixer above/to the side
would be by far the easiest to build
i feel like i would use this the most
