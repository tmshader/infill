**Goal:**
*<300$ (400mm)²x250mm CoreXY enclosed 3D printer*

**Author:** [@playlogo](https://github.com/playlogo)
**Repository:** [https://github.com/playlogo/billig](https://github.com/playlogo/billig)
**Total hours so far:** 5.5
**3D Printer available:** Yes

**Bom**: [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1451xPwitG2cd0BywjLuyT1Flae_F1tCVU7JKSqZtRoc/edit?usp=sharing)
**CAD**: [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d0a1f0aa5ccbfda89a60ed00/w/724bd13dc87be16ac72aafeb/e/ab5d18244eafa3c49944618e?renderMode=0&uiState=67cdf3b468bb893dcada95f7)

**Status Update**: Due to final school exams, hackboard and terminal-craft the timeline has been delayed by one and a half weeks. This means i will be aiming for OpenSauce and not RMRRF.

**Journal Overview:**

| Date | Total time | Description | Happy with progress ? |
|------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| [08.3](#march-8---3h)|     3h     | Brainstorming & Gathering & Online research | Yes, finally locked in on one idea. Was really torn between the print farm, module based printer and Billig|
| [09.3](#march-9---25h) | 2.5h | Documentation & Organization | Yes, really happy: Did all the annoying markdown formatting and stuff |

**Timeline:**

| Date | Estimated hours | Description | Possible motivational problems |  
|------|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| 09.03 - 16.03 | 10h - 20h | Research & Parts selection - Found vendors, lock-in parts for everything, created BOM with estimate expenses, find / create CAD models for individual parts, create dimensionally accurate design specification | Unlikely - I love organizing, planning, and shopping for stuff |
| 17.03 - 23.03 | 15h - 20h | CAD design - covert design specification into CAD (and find a dark theme for onshape)| Maybe - Staring at a CAD design for multiple hours, multiple days strait can be ... exhausting |
| 24.03 - 27.03 | - 10h | Implement "Should-have" features | Unlikely - Improving a finished Design should be really motivating, cause you see what you've achieved |
| 28.03 - 31.03 |  | Buffer | |

Total expected hours: ~45h
Real-life multiplier: x1.5 -> 68h -> ~3h per day -> Realistic

**Features:**

| Must-have | Should-have | Probably not enough time|
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| (400mm)² for X&Y, Z should have 200mm+ | Filament runout sensor | 2 Build-in filament holders (Prusa Core style: inset into case, on the left&right) |
| CoreXY with Belts | LED-Bar under Bed for status, etc| Build-in filament weight sensor (using [one of these](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/33046037411.html))|
| Enclosed (for ABS) | Exhaust air filtration using [activated carbon](https://meltbro.de/nevermore-activated-carbon-aktivkohle-fuer-voron-2-4-0-1-0-2-trident-3d-drucker.html) | External [Multi-filament switcher (Pico-MMU, 2 filaments)](https://www.printables.com/model/1083174-mmu-multi-material-upgrade)|
| Direct drive | | |
| ABL using cheap [BLTouch clone](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005007554425544.html)| | |
| Temperature Sensor inside & Temp-control fans | | |

### March 8 - 3h

Brainstorming about goal. Final 3 candidates:

- Print farm: Similar to [this](https://blog.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC6780-scaled.jpeg) - Why not: Basically would only copy their design and scale it down, due to budget only 2 integrated printers -> kinda useless
- Module based: 250x250x100mm modules with only the heated, joinable in one direction, rack & pinion system on the sides, hotend on a ["crane" (picture explains it best)](https://image.made-in-china.com/203f0j00dwPqjhLbGOkI/Zpmc-Spreader-for-Rtg-Type-Container-Gantry-Crane.webp) - Why not: Budget would only allow ~2 modules -> Print volume way to small
- Billig (this): There seems to be no big (~(400mm)³) enclosed printer for under 1k -> Should be doable with only 300$ when cutting corners

Billig will be a mix of:

- [Prusa XL](https://blog.prusa3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/main_1.jpg) (frame design)
- [Voron 2.4](https://cdn03.plentymarkets.com/ioseuwg7moqp/item/images/29251/full/Copymaster3D-Voron2-V2-4-R2-SB-Kit-350-x-350-x-350mm-With-StealthBurner-29251.png) (artistic style)
- [Ender 3 NG](https://media.printables.com/media/prints/922401/images/7302744_6c89a110-ee20-4af6-ad0b-d029573e6b25_aa334db1-1287-41b3-9dea-289b26e3adf5/thumbs/inside/1280x960/jpg/dsc03455_fhd.webp) (enclosure design)

Accepted tradeoffs:

- Longevity: Will be using the cheapest parts for everything
- Print speed: Won't be fast due to size
- Power draw: Will need A LOT of energy to heatup the entire chamber

Initial design ideas:

- Printbed consist of 4 [smaller (and cheaper) print beds](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005007288279620.html): ~ 40€ total
