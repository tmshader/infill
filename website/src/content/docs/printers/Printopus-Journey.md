Total hours so far: 75+
BTW I have an Ender 3 V3 KE <i>really fast</i>

## Before we Start!! :
What is special in this printer:

* Auto bed leveling
* Working on adding a filament dryer mount in my printer with a bowden setup! First of its kind.
* Auto Print remover + cleaner with servo!!!(i will add the wedge later so that i will know the bed height before adding it)    -------------------------------->
* Input shaping mounts added with adxl343 accelerometer
* No more Z-Banding(dont ask me about my old printer z banding) I have added Aluminum Flexible Jaw Spider Shaft which reduces the chance of z banding.
* My printer looks sci-fi with a Sci-fi Themed PRINTER HOLDer!! woohoo

If you are wondering how i will add my filament dry box i have already cut a hole in the dry box to fit my bowden setup

yeah since i am using bowden
i will cut a hole in my filament dryer
and mount it sideways next to the bondtech extruder!
I have already cut the hole lol

## Day 1 (13th Feb 2025) :
## Total time 1.5 hour!!! Started from 6pm
### 1st 30 mins <i>Off to a great start!</i>
I researched many printers I could make including this one for the basic idea - 

[The whole video playlist!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyYZUiBHD1QjaYx7eCEW8zXvsgwEbAykY)

### The other 1 Hour
Researched some more parts and...
I made this mindmap for my printer <img src="https://cdn.hack.pet/slackcdn/edb8cf33ad4d4399f83603ccd04398b3.png">

## And this is the end of DAY 1!! <i>I am so sleep deprived :( </i>

<hr>

## Day 2 (14th Feb 2025) :
## Total Time 2 Hours!!! Started from 3:15 pm

Designing and finding the frame! I am using some extrusions!
I researched for a long time.. <i>Not kidding :(</i> Time for extrusion frames cheap and good quality with fast shipping and I found these-
https://www.3dprintronics.com/products/aluminium-extrusions
<b>Researched the SKR Mainboard -</b> 
https://robu.in/product/bigtreetech-skr-v1-4-control-board/?gad_source=4&gclid=CjwKCAiAk8G9BhA0EiwAOQxmfhkp0i08jJYeySLA4vNOAmef0a8bFC9ivwNMua4mY5DsqRokWoi2nBoCKCMQAvD_BwE
I had to figure out how does UART Stepper motors are compatible with it also.
The motors(stepper) -

## Day 3 - High Fever 🤒

## Day 4 (16th Feb 2025) :
## Total time 4 Hours!!! Started from 1 pm (No school!)

I had to research the skr board first because many pins are very confusing. I decided to go with the btt skr v1.4 board and I found this very useful link - 
[Official site info](https://biqu.equipment/products/bigtreetech-skr-v1-4-skr-v1-4-turbo-control-board-tmc2209-tmc2208-eeprom-v1-0-exp-mot-v1-0-3d-printer-parts-for-ender-3?_pos=1&_sid=a4a30553b&_ss=r&variant=31898702970978)

Surprisingly you also get a rubber duck! yay!
<img src="https://cdn.hack.pet/slackcdn/e3cbb84e79686741e227042714625f6e.png">
Also THANKS A LOT to whoever made this video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRpWtx3HCGM

It helped me choose the stepper motor drivers because I did know if I needed uart and what jumpers I needed to use on the board! This is very confusing.
I am also using a touch screen - tft24

Now I have lots of things on my mind that I have to buy so I decided to start working with the bom sheet!

Here is the unfinished work of the spreadsheet:

## Day 5 (17th Feb 2025) My High Fever 🤒 Still there :(
## Total Time 2 Hours!!! Started From 2 pm
Started to update the [BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NrEE28tm0ULvl5nzLH3Xo_gENOVdaQEKzp27CuxsBW8/edit?usp=sharing)

Researched about the Bowden style extruder and where to buy them.

I will be using A V6 Hotend:

I will be using a dual-drive extruder:

## Day 6 (18th Feb 2025) Fever 🤒 Still there :(
## Total Time 1 Hours!!! Started From 2 pm

Added many things to the BOM! I found many cheaper sites so I had to update them all!
Did many other stuff

## Day 7 (19th Feb 2025) I am feeling better than before!
## Total time 2 Hours!!! Started from 1 pm

Today I started working on the 3D model of my printer since I was bored to hell updating the BOM every day!

First, I needed to design the 4040 Extrusions! Luckily I found them on GrabCAD. Now I will make the Frame

Yeah, I had to watch so many tutorials and I was doing everything manually debugging a lot. Now I realize how bad I am :(. But I still made it!

## Day 8 to 19 (20 to 13th March 2025) Sorry to lazy to write everything!
## Total time 9.75 Hours !!! 45 mins Everyday (i had to make a routine bruh)

I worked on the cad files every day and since I am a noob in fusion it took me some time to make the final result of the frame with the heated!

I made this till now NOT DONE!
<img src="https://cloud-4e63ja77b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0image.png">

I will soon upload the newer cad file!

## Day 21-34 (14th March to 27th March 2025)
## Total time 28 hours 45 mins(i grinded)

Yo guys, wassup Ik i haven't updated for a long time since my parents only gave me 45 minutes to work on this cause I have exams, and I am trying to finish everything before my main exams come!!!

SO THIS IS THE UPDATE!
I added input shaping mounts for accelerometer!
I havent built a printer so this is a big thing for me so In the last few days and these days I WATCHES VERY VIDEO on this series - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP-VDZmS6bFo6qyPS8MyBFKqepQHpjCEB&si=mJB7cQvZAObcFmbE Because why not I am definetly usng this mainboard and since we ARE GOING to RMRRF which have people building cool stuff like 6 second nozzle changes even I wanted to ttry to implement something cool. Hence, I needed to know what my mainboard could do!

Now for the main updates i did today is I FINISHED THE Y AXIS (and i have become noob -> master in fusion 360) <- wow so cringe And Yeah i did everything manually I DINT even KNOW AALIGN TOOL EXISTED. I ALWAYS MANUALLY Made everything fit together. But now I am done with the y-axis. I promise everything will be faster from now on because I'm like 70% done less goo.

Here is a photo of what I finished 
<img src="https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/30a417ba20dcbe8eca39584449c6ae24da78e02f_image.png">

And also i have almost finished my shitty BOM here is a sneak peek:

I don't know but my fusion is definitely not organized, bruh :(

Thanks, ppl more updates soon!
Sneak peak: working on a good PCB

## Day 35 (28th March 2025)
## Total time 4 Hours

Hi guys,
I know i havent updated this for a while but I am:(drumroll)

working on my printer to be sci fi themed

99% DONE WITH MY CAD FILES
I have started with my pcb for the neopixels and the bom please dont talk about it
I Need too finishs the bom when i am done (it will be a pain)

Now for the pcb i am using klipper with Skr mini e3 v3 and neopixels
I found this helpfull link which i might chekc out later on : https://www.reddit.com/r/klippers/comments/rdbmp2/klipper_neopixels_on_skr_e3_mini_v2_working_how/

I wanted to change colors like for heating: orange
for error:red
for printing:bluish pink
and for leevling or any equipment test :green

I might add more later on like for moonraker timelapse each time it takes a photo the blush pink changes to white for a clear photo.

Here is my almost finished printer cad( i have to do the electronics storing base ):

<img src = "https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/a30304e386ae6883a8906d1a740caca2b589781e_image.png">
<img src = "https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/cc4a02ddc4f37cee0ec6ee9cad8cab46ad3b04b6_image.png">

I know it looks a bit ugly but after building its going to be 🔥

Thats all for today maybe tommorow and later on i will give more updates and phoos aobut the pcb since my exams are officially over.

## Day 36 (29th March 2025)
## Total time 4 Hours

Hi Ppl
I have designed the first layout of my pcb and also learnt some kicad.
I researched a lot on how to wire a capacitor but couldnt get any info for neopixels.
So in this pcb v1 I have done everything without capacitor:

A reddit post for my capacitor thing: https://www.reddit.com/r/PCB/comments/1jo8qhs/soldering_neopixels_ws2812c_with_jlcpcbs_assembly/

Thats all for today i will wait for a reply on reddit.

## Day 36 (29th March 2025)
## Total time 3 Hours

I have started working on a filament dryer mount for my printer which gets the filament directly from the dryer!!

I worked more on the Cad Files of printopus
Here is my finished and updated pcb with some copper blocks and a capacitor which unfortunately i dont have a 3d of but you can see the pins:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nu0PDfO.png">

3d Model?
