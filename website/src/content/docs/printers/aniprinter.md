# Aniprinter - The anime printer :3

Anime printer!!! I'm gonna add some cat ears lol

Made by: @Cyao

Respository link: https://github.com/cheyao/aniprinter

Hours so far: 1.5h

- [x] I have a bambu A1 mini and access to larger school printers

Printer for my ani* set of hardware!

## The plan

I don't fucking know but I'll figure it out in the vacations. I never failed anything when money isn't a constraint :D

1. Capable of printing figurines
2. Multicolor!!! 8+ colors!
3. 310x310x310+mm
4. Cute & colorful
5. Have removable cat ears on it (Dad's killing me if he sees cat ears TwT)
Extra: Be able to print some metalic filament, that would be soo cool

How to source the parts cheaply? I'm buying everything from china lol
