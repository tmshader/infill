## Progress Log

### Day 0: February 13, 2025 (0.5 hours)
- **Initial Ideation:**
  - Conceptualized the ED3D project: a 3D printer with a transparent display to visualize the print in real time.

### Day 1: February 15, 2025 (5 hours)
- **Research & Planning:**
  - Investigated 3D printer architectures and display technologies.
  - Updated the BOM to include potential components for holographic visualization.
  - Assessed mechanical/display integration feasibility.

### Days 2–4: February 16–18, 2025 (11 hours)
- **Component Research & Design Skills:**
  - Sourced mechanical and electronic parts for the BOM.
  - Learned basic 3D modeling techniques for part design and visualization.

### Day 5: February 20, 2025 (4 hours)
- **Hardware Assembly:**
  - Finalized the BOM.
  - Cadded the printer frame using welded galvanized square steel tubing.

### Days 6–16: February 21–March 2, 2025 (24 hours)
- **Z-Axis Development:**
  - Began construction of the Z-axis assembly, thinking of using lead screw instead of ball screw actuator
  - Revised BOM based on component fit and new constraints.

### Days 17–22: March 2–6, 2025 (5 hours)
- **Heatbed Mounting & Continued Research:**
  - Added support structure for the heatbed, revised z axis to use lead screw, linear rail and linear shaft.
  - Continued background research.

### Days 23–30: March 7–13, 2025 (30 hours)
- **Z-Axis Finalization & XY Initiation:**
  - Completed Z-axis mechanics and calibration, decided on 1 linear rail, 1 lead screw, 2 linear shafts.
  - Began building the XY axis using belt-driven motion systems. Corexy belt routing from reprap website.

### Days 31–37: March 13–20, 2025 (23 hours)
- **XY Axis & Toolhead Development:**
  - Completed XY axis assembly.
  - Initiated design and construction of the toolhead. Using 2 4010 axial fans and 1 4010 blower for cooling and v6 e3d hotend clone. Im also going to be using a bl sensor.
