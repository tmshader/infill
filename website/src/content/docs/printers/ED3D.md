# ED3D Project Journal

**Author:** [@karnx](https://github.com/Fastestkyo)  
**Repository:** [https://github.com/Fastestkyo/ED3D](https://github.com/Fastestkyo/ED3D)  
**Total Time Spent:** 20.5 hours (as of last update)

## Progress Log

### Day 0: February 13, 2025 (0.5 hours)
- **Initial Ideation:**
  - Conceptualized the ED3D project: a 3D printer with a transparent display to visualize the print in real time.

### Day 1: February 15, 2025 (5 hours)
- **Research & Planning:**
  - Researched transparent screen and stuff. This video was very sigma https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhldXT7yxXo
  - Started with the BOM. EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE IN INDIA üò≠. Added basic stuff like galvanized square steel, or skr mini e3v3.


### Days 2‚Äì4: February 16‚Äì18, 2025 (11 hours)
- **Component Research & Design Skills:**
  - Sourced mechanical and electronic parts for the BOM. EXPENSIVEE!!
  - Learned basic 3D modeling techniques for part design and visualization.

### Day 5: February 20, 2025 (4 hours)
- **Hardware Assembly:**
  - Updated the BOM. Added other electronic components.
  - Cadded the printer frame using welded galvanized square steel tubing.

### Days 6‚Äì16: February 21‚ÄìMarch 2, 2025 (24 hours)
- **Z-Axis Development:**
  - Began construction of the Z-axis assembly, thinking of using lead screw instead of ball screw actuator. 
  - Revised BOM based on component fit and new constraints.

### Days 17‚Äì22: March 2‚Äì6, 2025 (5 hours)
- **Heatbed Mounting & Continued Research:**
  - Added support structure for the heatbed, revised z axis to use lead screw, linear rail and linear shaft.
  - Continued background research. Thinking of adding bl sensor. bl sensor very expensive in india (75 dolla)

### Days 23‚Äì30: March 7‚Äì13, 2025 (30 hours)
- **Z-Axis Finalization & XY Initiation:**
  - Completed Z-axis mechanics and calibration, decided on 1 linear rail, 1 lead screw, 2 linear shafts.
  - Began building the XY axis using belt-driven motion systems. Corexy belt routing from reprap website.

### Days 31‚Äì37: March 13‚Äì20, 2025 (23 hours)
- **XY Axis & Toolhead Development:**
  - Completed XY axis assembly.
  - Initiated design and construction of the toolhead. Using 2 4010 axial fans and 1 4010 blower for cooling and v6 e3d hotend clone. Im also going to be using a bl sensor.

### Days 38‚Äì40: March 20‚Äì23, 2025 (26.5 hours)
- **Toolhead Completion:**
  - Finalized toolhead mechanics and mounted extruder assembly.
  - Revised BOM cuz of expensive parts ü§´üßè‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
