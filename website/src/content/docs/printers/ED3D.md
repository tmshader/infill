## Progress Log

### Day 0: February 13, 2025 (0.5 hours)
- **Initial Ideation:**
  - Conceptualized the ED3D project: a 3D printer with a transparent/holographic display to visualize the print in real time.

### Day 1: February 15, 2025 (5 hours)
- **Research & Planning:**
  - Investigated 3D printer architectures and display technologies.
  - Updated the BOM to include potential components for holographic visualization.
  - Assessed mechanical/display integration feasibility.

### Days 2–4: February 16–18, 2025 (11 hours)
- **Component Research & Design Skills:**
  - Sourced mechanical and electronic parts for the BOM.
  - Learned basic 3D modeling techniques for part design and visualization.

### Day 5: February 20, 2025 (4 hours)
- **Hardware Assembly:**
  - Finalized the BOM.
  - Built the printer frame using welded galvanized square steel tubing.

### Days 6–16: February 21–March 2, 2025 (24 hours)
- **Z-Axis Development:**
  - Began construction of the Z-axis assembly.
  - Revised BOM based on component fit and new constraints.
