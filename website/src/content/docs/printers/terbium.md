### **February 10, 2024**  
**9:00 PM - 9:20 PM**  
Opened Onshape. Drew a cube. Deleted cube. Felt like a tech genius. Created GitHub repo. Wrote README: *"Terbium: The Printer of Tomorrow (if tomorrow is chaos)."* Pushed empty files.

### **February 11, 2024**  
**2:00 PM - 3:00 PM**  
Watched a 2012 YouTube tutorial titled *"How to Build a Printer for $50."* Spoiler: You canâ€™t. Guy used **wooden frames** and **fishing line belts**. Panic-sketched backup plan involving duct tape.  
**3:15 PM - 3:25 PM**  
Googled *"how to 3D print a 3D printer."* Realized this is a paradox. Texted friend: *"Am I in a loop?"*

### **February 14, 2024**  
**7:00 PM - 10:00 PM**  
AliExpress window shopping:  
- **7:30 PM**: Found NEMA17 motors labeled *"48mm height."* Sellerâ€™s name: *TrustMeBroElectronics*. Added to cart.  
- **8:45 PM**: Added 10m of GT2 belt. Reviews said *"snaps like dry spaghetti."*  
- **9:30 PM**: Added 100 M3 screws. Why? Because bulk = cheap.  
- **10:00 PM**: Closed tab. *"Iâ€™ll order laterâ€¦ maybe."* Lied.

### **February 16, 2024**  
**9:00 AM - 6:30 PM**  
CAD all-nighter (with breaks for rage):  
- **9:00 AM**: Designed a bracket. Realized itâ€™s 2D. *"3D printers need 3D parts, dumbass."*  
- **11:30 AM**: Learned how to extrude. Made a 3D bracket. Celebrated with chips.  
- **2:00 PM**: Tried rotating part. It flipped upside-down. Googled *"how to rotate in Onshape."*  
- **4:00 PM**: Gave up. Drew a cube again. Deleted cube.  
- **6:00 PM**: Pushed to GitHub: *"v0.0.1 - Itâ€™s a bracketâ€¦ kinda."*

### **February 18, 2024**  
**1:00 PM - 7:48 PM**  
**1:00 PM**: Started Y-axis. Used centimeters like a fool.  
**3:00 PM**: Realized bed is 2100mm. *"Printer for kaiju?!"*  
**4:30 PM**: Redrew everything in millimeters. Cried.  
**7:00 PM**: Pushed fix: *"mm > cm. Iâ€™m an idiot."*

### **February 21, 2024**  
**10:00 AM - 12:15 PM**  
**10:00 AM**: Modeled Y-axis belts. Pulleys collided with air. Onshape error: *"Conflict with ghosts."*  
**11:30 AM**: Offset pulleys 5mm. Belts phased through motors. *"Fourth-dimensional engineering!"*  
**12:00 PM**: Pushed to GitHub: *"Y-axis exists. Donâ€™t ask how."*  

**2:00 PM - 5:30 PM**  
**2:00 PM**: Bed design. Added hexagons. Realized theyâ€™re invisible.  
**4:00 PM**: Engraved *"TERBIUM"* on bed. Regretted immediately.  
**5:00 PM**: Pushed: *"Bed now 50% regret."*

### **February 22, 2024**  
**9:00 AM - 12:22 PM**  
**9:00 AM**: Z-axis time! Tried lead screws. Forgot nuts.  
**10:30 AM**: Simulated motion. Screws bent like wet noodles.  
**11:45 AM**: Switched to belts. Belts sagged. Switched back.  
**12:00 PM**: GitHub Issue: *"Z-axis is a lie. Send help."*

### **February 23, 2024**  
**3:00 PM - 6:10 PM**  
**3:00 PM**: Printhead design. Wanted modular hotend.  
**4:30 PM**: Forgot thermal expansion. Mount melts in theory.  
**5:00 PM**: Added 0.5mm gap. *"Air cooling!"*  
**6:00 PM**: Pushed: *"Hotend held by hopes and dreams."*  

---  

### **February 26, 2024**  
**7:00 PM - 7:20 PM**  
Ran *"CFD"* on fan ducts. Airflow launched prints into orbit.  
**7:15 PM**: Added 3 more fans. *"Cooling solved (lol)."*

### **February 27, 2024**  
**1:00 PM - 6:18 PM**  
**1:00 PM**: Shook CAD model. Frame wobbled like jelly.  
**3:00 PM**: Added 12 L-brackets. Now looks like a bridge built by pigeons.  
**6:00 PM**: Pushed: *"Frame 50% brackets, 50% shame."*

### **February 28, 2024**  
**10:00 AM - 4:01 PM**  
**10:00 AM**: Belt routing hell. Pulleys collided with nothing.  
**2:30 PM**: Deleted pulleys. Belts float now. *"Physics optional."*  
**3:45 PM**: GitHub Issue: *"Belts are imaginary. Trust the process."*

### **March 2, 2024**  
**11:00 AM - 3:30 PM**  
**11:00 AM**: Extruder design. Filament path intersects frame.  
**1:00 PM**: Offset gears 2mm. *"Self-clearancingâ„¢ technology."*  
**3:00 PM**: Pushed: *"Extruder eats itself. Feature, not bug."*  

---  

### **March 12, 2024**  
**4:00 PM - 7:55 PM**  
**4:00 PM**: Rendered frame neon green. *"Retinas burned."*  
**6:00 PM**: Switched to purple. Added RGB LEDs.  
**7:30 PM**: Pushed: *"Printer now rave-ready. ðŸŒˆ"*

### **March 20, 2024**  
**8:00 AM - 2:33 PM**  
**8:00 AM**: Exported STLs. Parts intersect. Tolerances? Never heard of â€™em.  
**2:00 PM**: Pushed: *"Print at your own risk. ðŸ”¥"*

### **Vibe Check**  
- **CAD Hours:** *"99h 23m"*  
- **Confidence:** *"Itâ€™ll workâ€¦ maybe."*  
- **Aesthetic:** *Lisa Frankâ€™s nightmare.*  
- **Next Step:** *Order partsâ€¦ or burn it all.*  

*Terbium: Because buying a printer is for nerds with money.* ðŸ’¸ðŸ”¥
