# Terbium 3D Printer Journal  
**Repo:** [github.com/akulsaju/terbium](https://github.com/akulsaju/terbium)  
 **CAD Hours:** *"99h 23m"* 
  
---  


### **February 10, 2024**  
**Task**: Project Planning  
**Time**: 20 minutes  
**Notes**:  
- Defined core objectives: affordability, modularity, and compatibility with standard components.  
- Researched frame materials and motion systems (Cartesian vs. CoreXY).  

---

### **February 11, 2024**  
**Task**: Preliminary Research  
**Time**: 1 hour  
**Notes**:  
- Reviewed open-source printer designs (Prusa i3, Ender 3) for inspiration.  
- Selected GT2 belts and NEMA17 motors for cost-effectiveness.  

---

### **February 14, 2024**  
**Task**: Component Sourcing Plan  
**Time**: 3 hours  
**Notes**:  
- Drafted initial BOM with AliExpress parts:  
  - **Motion**: MGN9C rails, 8mm linear rods, LM8LUU bearings.  
  - **Electronics**: 24V PSU, BLTouch, modular mainboard.  
- Highlighted risks: inconsistent motor specs, rail tolerances.  

---

### **February 16â€“18, 2024**  
**Task**: CAD Modeling (Frame & Y-Axis)  
**Time**: 15.5 hours  
**Notes**:  
- **Frame**: Designed 2020 aluminum extrusion structure in Onshape.  
- **Y-Axis**:  
  - Dual 8mm linear rods with LM8LUU bearings.  
  - Unit error discovered (cm instead of mm), requiring full redesign.  
  - Implemented spring-loaded GT2 belt tensioners post-correction.  

---

### **February 21, 2024**  
**Task**: Y-Axis Optimization & Bed Design  
**Time**: 5.5 hours  
**Notes**:  
- Adjusted pulley alignment to prevent belt derailment.  
- Modeled 210x210mm heated bed with silicone thermal pads.  

---

### **February 22â€“23, 2024**  
**Task**: Z-Axis & Printhead Development  
**Time**: 6 hours  
**Notes**:  
- **Z-Axis**: Switched from lead screws to belts due to wobble in simulation.  
- **Printhead**: Designed modular mount for Bambu X1-style hotend with dual 4010 cooling fans.  

---

### **February 26â€“28, 2024**  
**Task**: Thermal & Structural Analysis  
**Time**: 5.5 hours  
**Notes**:  
- **CFD**: Revised fan ducts to reduce turbulent airflow.  
- **Frame Rigidity**: Added cross-bracing to reduce resonant vibrations.  

---

### **March 1â€“5, 2024**  
**Task**: Motion System Refinement  
**Time**: 11 hours  
**Notes**:  
- Upgraded to fiberglass-reinforced GT2 belts to minimize resonance.  
- Integrated 3:1 gear reduction for improved motor torque.  

---

### **March 7â€“20, 2024**  
**Task**: Final Assembly Checks  
**Time**: 10 hours  
**Notes**:  
- Adjusted X-axis carriage to prevent collisions with Z-axis brackets.  
- Validated bed leveling mechanism (Â±0.1mm precision).  
---  

### **Overall**  
- **CAD Hours:** *"99h 23m"*
- **BOM:** *"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OlRZbKyhsi1nM5R4tDLmwMiiqEgzE4qpPp_ct5iw9p4/edit?usp=sharing "*
