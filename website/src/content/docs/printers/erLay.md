erLay is a ultra-portable CoreXY 3D printer made by [Evan Yu](https://evanyu.dev) and [Aaron Huang](https://runthebot.me)

This printer is built to print small parts needed fast at robotics competitions where our main limitations are space and time. This printer will mainly print spacers, shaft collars, pullies, etc.

# Goals (we didn't manage to hit all of these within budget)
- Ultra-portable (for robotics competitions!!)
- Pico MMU (Optional)
- Zero Click ABL (Optional)
- Built-in carrying case (The printer will collapse into something like a pelican case)
- Can be powered by a (multiple) power banks
- NO STANDARD EXTRUSION (I think they look ewww and too normal)

# Features
- Locally sourced frame
- Easy to disassemble
- Core XY
- Klipper
