erLay is a ultra-portable CoreXY 3D printer made by [Evan Yu](https://evanyu.dev) and [Aaron Huang](https://runthebot.me)

This printer is built to print small parts needed fast at robotics competitions where our main limitations are space and time. This printer will mainly print spacers, shaft collars, pullies, etc.

# Goals (we didn't manage to hit all of these within budget)
- Ultra-portable (for robotics competitions!!)
- Pico MMU (Optional) (Not in budget ðŸ˜­)
- Zero Click ABL (Optional)
- Built-in carrying case (The printer will collapse into something like a pelican case) (Gave up on this one. see journal)
- Can be powered by a (multiple) power banks (Gave up on this one)
- NO STANDARD EXTRUSION (I think they look ewww and too normal)

# Features (Items in the final build)
- Locally sourced frame (Proudly Canadian)
- Easy to disassemble (8 Bolts)
- Core XY
- Klipper
- NeoPixel LEDs

# Interesting note on design!
As you will notice, most of the frame is built out of linear rods. I was inspired by hex shafts in FRC and how we tap them and use a bolt to clamp both sides. I decided to do this for infill to maximize rigidity and minimize construction/deconstruction time.
