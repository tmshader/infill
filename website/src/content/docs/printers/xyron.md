- [x] I have a 3d printer right now.
## Day one
### Research
Today I spent a lot of time looking an=t a lot of different options and at the end I decided on making a core XY machine. I looked through a lot of different models on printables and I think I got the basic principles of how one of these machines would work.
### My goal
My goal with this 3d printer is to 3d print as many of the parts as possible from the frame, to whatever crosses my mind. I also feel like a auto print remover would be something simple to add with just a servo, that would make the printer way cooler.
### Design
I started with onshape, and got a liitle of the gantry done. 
### time
4 hours 30 minutes

## Day two
### Design
Today I learnt a little bit more about onShape and got continued with the assembaly. Most of my time just was spent figuring out how to use the assembaly.
### Time
5 hours and 30 minutes

## Day three
### Design
Today I continues working on the gantry and now have to work on the tool head. The X and Y linear rods are finished with the modeling.
### Time
6 hours.

## Day four
### Design
Today I did a lot of work on the gantry, and added some screws on the assembally, however I realized that I forgot about the idelers, so I have to do that later. 
### Time
Today I spent 5 hours on the design.
## Day five
### Design
Today I have redesign a lot of the parts because I forgot the idlers, I also redid the assembally and a ton of the parts, It was so annoying that I had to make so many changes for one tiny thing
Time 5 and a half hours.
## Day six
### Design
Today I did a lot of designing, made the x axis with the linear rods, and though about ways that I could do bed leveling. I decided on just using screws, and rubber bands to hold the bed in place
### Time
Six and a half hours.
## Day seven
### Design
Today I continued working on the bed and started my BOM.BOM. I finished most of it, then realized that I would also need am extruder, so I had to model a mount for that.
### Time
8 hours.

## Day Eight
### Design
Today I worked on the z axis movement and got some suggestions for the printer, so I also added some clearances. I updated my BOM, and got it down to $130 (Not counting filament, or taxes), and I realized that I forgot to mount my SKR Mini, so I will do that tomorrow.

### TIme
4 and a half hours.
## Day nine
### Design
Today I just adjusted some clearances, and mounted the board to the printer. I guess that Now I will submit the file, and ask for the grant, so I will keep my fingers crossed that it will get accepted.

### Time
2 hours.

## Day nine
### Design
Today I mainly just ordered parts, and researched for some better deals. I also researched for a filament extruder.
### Time
Five and a half hours.

## Day ten
### Design
Today I satrted getting some of parts, and just did some assembling, and printed a hot end holder out of petg, although I did suffer some stringing, but it worked well enough.
### Time 
three hours.

## Day eleven
### Design
Today I just continued with assembly mounted the motors, and started screwing parts together. I might have made the holes too small for the heat set inserts, but at the end I expeanded it with a wood burner, so it worked out.
### Time
Seven hours.

## Day twelve
### Desgin
Today I worked on assembling the gantry, and I did a lot of trying to getting the bearings into the part where I could screw them into the back.
### Time
four and a half hours.
