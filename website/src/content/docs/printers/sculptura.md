sculptura is a wip fully **open-source** and customized budget 3d printer made from scratch for printing smooth, detailed and precise models that are meant to to be used as high quality decorative pieces (like you would see at an art gallery) :D


## daily log
### ⋆ day one - day ten — initial research (time taken: ~ 15h)
found out more about how 3d printers work by reading documents, watching youtube videos, looking at existing open-source builds (including neutrino), sketching out what i was trying to achieve. i loosely consulted reddit threads that answered my super specific questions and asked a lot of questions on dedicated discord servers (i'm surprised they didn't ban me for being annoying). i did my initial light research on:
- frame and motion system
  - frame design & materials
  - printer kinematics & motion types
  - linear motion
  - belt & pulley system
- extruder and hotend
  [i spent a lot of time going back and forth to decide whether i wanted to make a clay printer (since the name of my printer is sculptura) but ultimately decided against it and took the traditional route]
  - hotend types
  - nozzles & material compatibility
  - direct drive
- bed and print surface
- firmware (will run klipper)
- electronics
  - mainboard selection
  - stepper motor drivers
  - power supply & wiring

at this point i obviously knew only the basics so nothing was set in stone but i started to form a **very rough image** in my head of what my printer would look like and started to make interations on the components i had chosen and added to my current bom before i started cad-ding and got in too deep!
