# sculptura ☆.ᐟ

sculptura is a wip fully **open-source** and customized budget 3d printer made from scratch for [infill](infill.hackclub.com) at hack club for printing smooth and precise models that are meant to to be used as decorative pieces :D

## planning

### ⋆ overview
- build volume: ~220x220x250mm
- multi-color & silent operation
- doesn't start on fire
- costs <250$ excluding costs of filament (im working with a bambu lab a1 mini)
- designed for printing functional decorative pieces over the industrial applications

### ⋆ desired specifications
- rigid braced aluminum frame + improved stability (wrt ender3 v3se)
- higher print resolution (0.1mm layer height capability)
- prints pla (silk, matte, wood, marble, metal-infused), transparent petg, tpu
- cartesian (since we need precise extrusion control and cooling rather than raw speed)
- smooth motion system + linear rails (if budget permits)
- runs klipper


## bill of materials
im currently researching stuff to make a comprehensive bom with everything i would require to make my printer come to life

## daily log
### ⋆ day one - initial research (time taken - 3 hours + ½ hour for readme)
started my journey by researching different 3D printer motion systems. the main types i considered were corexy, cartesian, and delta. after watching multiple comparison videos and reading user reviews, i decided on corexy and explored some popular diy corexy builds to understand potential designs:
- **[voron 0.1](https://vorondesign.com/voron0)** – super cool & compact
- **[vzbot](https://github.com/VZBot3D/VZBot)** – too complex and expensive
- **[ratrig v-core 3](https://ratrig.com/)** – over budget

### ⋆ day two -  frame & motion system (time taken - 3 hours)
to ensure stability while keeping costs low, i chose 2040 aluminum extrusions for the frame, offering a solid balance between rigidity and weight. for motion, i debated between <ins>linear rails</ins> (provide high precision and smooth movement but expensive) and <ins>pom wheels</ins> (budget-friendly and simpler to install but wear down over time). <br> <br> 
after reviewing multiple builds and cost analyses, i decided to start with pom wheels, knowing i can upgrade to linear rails later if needed. <br><br>

### ⋆ day three - extruder & hotend (time taken - 2 hours)
choosing the right extruder and hotend was crucial for handling various filament types, especially for multicolor printing. i considered the bmg clone (affordable, reliable, and widely used) and orbiter 2.0 (higher filament grip and better retraction control, reducing stringing) extruders and opted for <ins>orbiter 2.0</ins> for its improved grip and lightweight design. 

for the hotend, i needed something all-metal to handle a range of filaments (pla, petg, tpu, etc.). i chose the <ins>e3d v6 clone</ins>, as it provides good heat dissipation and consistent extrusion without ptfe degradation.

### ⋆ day four - heated bed & printed surface
a heated bed is essential for improving first-layer adhesion and preventing warping, especially when printing with materials like petg and abs. i needed a bed that could heat quickly and evenly across the surface, so i researched different heating solutions: pcb heater beds affordable but uneven heat distribution, silicone heater pads (expensive) and aluminium heated beds (good heat retention + even heating). after comparing options, i decided on a 12v or 24v heated bed with an aluminum plate, as its cheaper and durable.

a quality print surface is essential for good first-layer adhesion. i compared options of a glass bed (that's smooth but requires adhesive for some filaments) and pei-coated spring steel (that's flexible, durable w better adhesion) and textured powder coated pei (first-layer adhesion and provides a textured bottom layer) and chose the pei-coated spring steel sheet for easy print removal.
