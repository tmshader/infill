## about
sculptura is a fully **open-source** work-in-progress and customized budget corexy 3d printer that was made for hack club's #infill program <br>

## building
<b>aim -</b> an easy-to-assemble printer for printing smooth, detailed and precise models. handling aesthetic blends of filled/textured filaments at ease, making prints that are meant to to be used as high quality decorative pieces (like you would see at an art gallery). aka a printer designed for crisp details and clean surface textures, not industrial tolerances.

## features
- corexy incorporating a p1p-style z-axis
- build volume: 200×200×200 mm
- up to 300°C hotend temperature
- dedicated part cooling (5015 blower) & always-on hotend cooling (4010 fan)
- built for klipper firmware
- fits in the 500 USD budget & uses 150 USD of my own funds
- hackable and easy to remix: change build volume, components, mounts, etc.
- enclosable design for stable print environment + designed for easy assembly
- fully parametric cad design - [see here](https://a360.co/4czRthb)


## final results
sculptura's direct drive, high-temp hotend setup makes it great for fun filaments:
- wood pla
- marble pla
- silk pla
- glow-in-the-dark pla
- other aesthetic blends
- matte/fiber-filled filaments (pla, petg, etc.) <br>

it allows reliable extrusion of filaments without clogging or excessive stringing. plus with input shaping and linear rails, the printer minimizes ghosting and ringing resulting in cleaner ripple-free detailing and polished finishes.
