Total hours so far: 14

- [x] I have a 3D printer (Voxelab Aries)

3/23/2025 - Began Research (1 Hour)

I figured out what parts I needed and watched some videos of people building 3D printers.

My requirements:

- [x] Cartesian (since I already have a CoreXY)
- [x] I Will Build My Own UI in LVGL + Connect It to 3D Printer Firmware
- [x] Files Will Wirelessly Transfer with ESP32

4 Hours Process and Started Modeling The Base

I put together the V-Rails using a model I found online. I wasn't able to find a good one of the brackets used, so I modeled that myself in Fusion.

3/24/2025

2 Hours Worked Through Midnight - I continued to learn about cartesian printers and worked on adding linear rods.

Later that day...

3 Hours of Modeling After - I once I tried creating the cart to roll the X, Y, and Z axes, I became confused because I wasn't able to figure out how it worked. It had been a while since I had used a cartesian 3D prinet.

"This is WAY too hard. I'm switching by requirement from Cartesian to CoreXY, so I can 'copy' the printer I already have. Wish me luck."

Pondered for a while.

I temporarily give up. This project is to be continued, should I have time before the due date (hopefully).

Later that day...

NEVER GIVE UP NEVER WHAT-

-4 hours of modeling later-

"What was I thinking giving up???"

I began modeling the plate mounting Z-axis lift as well as noting the locations for the stepper motors.

-2 more hours later-

I have now completed the frame and modeled the PCB holder, which I'm not sure what material I will make that out of, but it will likely be a
