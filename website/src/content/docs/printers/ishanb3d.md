Total hours so far: 14

- [x] I have a 3D printer (Voxelab Aries)

3/23/2025 - Began Research (1 Hour)

My requirements:

- [x] Cartesian (since I already have a CoreXY)
- [x] I Will Build My Own UI in LVGL + Connect It to 3D Printer Firmware
- [x] Files Will Wirelessly Transfer with ESP32

4 Hours Process and Started Modeling The Base

3/24/2025

2 Hours Worked Through Midnight

Later that day...

3 Hours of Modeling After

This is WAY too hard. I'm switching by requirement from Cartesian to CoreXY, so I can 'copy' the printer I already have. Wish me luck.

Pondered for a while.

I temporarily give up. This project is to be continued, should I have time before the due date (hopefully).

Later that day...

NEVER GIVE UP NEVER WHAT-

-4 hours of modeling later-

"What was I thinking giving up???"
